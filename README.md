SQL/TSQL Scripts

Contains TSQL scripts to help the common SQL Server DBA tasks and automation. 

I started publishing blog posts at https://sqlpal.blogspot.com on SQL Server topics about a year ago.  Thanks to it's syndication at https://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/source/mission-sql-homeostasis, it has started to receive regular site visits. 

Most of my blogs so far are about scripts, TSQL & PowerShell. Creating this GitHub repo has been an after thought as I thought people who wants to try the scripts posted in my little blog posts can copy/paste right from the blog. Now it has occurred to me that it may sometimes have formatting issues due to the html nature of the blogs.

So this is an attempt to upload those scripts on GitHub, hoping it would make it easier to view and download the code from here.
